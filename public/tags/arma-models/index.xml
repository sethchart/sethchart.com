      <description>Last week, I finished a project where I identified the five zip codes, in the city of Baltimore, where an individual would expect the highest return on investment if they bought a house, lived in it for two years and then sold it and moved away. You can check out my GitHub repository for the project here. I used Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models to forecast house prices based on historical data that I collected from Zillow.</description>
