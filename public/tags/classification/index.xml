      <description>Project Description In this post, I will tell you about building my submission to the Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table competition hosted by DrivenData. The competition problem uses data about water pumps in Tanzania collected by a partnership between Taarifa and the United Republic of Tanzania Ministry of Water to predict if they are currently in need of repair. Specifically, the goal is to classify a water pump as &amp;lsquo;functional&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;functional needs repair&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;non functional&amp;rsquo; given the available data.</description>
