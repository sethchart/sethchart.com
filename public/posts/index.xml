      <description>A Long Story Shortened My name is Seth Chart. I am, in order of decreasing experience, a son, brother, mathematician, teacher, husband, feline personal assistant, database manager, python programmer, web development hobbyist, data scientist, and blogger.
Biography The Early Years I grew up in Utah. My Father is a Fisheries Biologist who has spent his career working to protect endangered fish species in the western United States. Most of my early memories were formed when we lived in Moab, Utah, where he managed a research field station.</description>

As I started work on the project I noticed that I was spending a huge amount of time cleaning data, combining data from multiple sources, cleaning the combined data, and whittling down the resulting data so that I could produce a particular summary of the data.</description>
