<p>My name is Seth Chart.
I am, in order of decreasing experience, a son, brother, mathematician, teacher, husband, feline personal assistant, database manager, python programmer, web development hobbyist,  data scientist, and blogger.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography<a class="anchor" href="#biography">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-early-years">The Early Years<a class="anchor" href="#the-early-years">#</a></h3>
<p>I grew up in Utah.
My Father is a Fisheries Biologist who has spent his career working to protect endangered fish species in the western United States.
Most of my early memories were formed when we lived in Moab, Utah, where he managed a research field station.</p>
<p>My mother homeschooled me (and my younger brother) through all of elementary and middle school.
By the time I reached high school, we had moved to Salt Lake City, Utah.
I attended the public high school part-time and continued to be homeschooled part-time through senior year.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the decades that my mother spent building a bespoke early education for me (and my brother).
My education was truly one of a kind, tailored to my interests and idiosyncrasies.
The way that I learned during those years was open and free in a way that almost none of my peers have ever had the privilege of experiencing.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the way that my father has always taught by example.
As a young boy, I had the opportunity to ride along with my father on trips and watch him take joy from the hard work of a field biologist.
I got to see that, sometimes, collecting data means driving for hours on dirt roads into the desert, rowing a raft down a river for days to access a habitat, strapping on waders and pulling a seine through chest deep water, then carefully sorting through the contents of the net and collecting and labeling the tiny larval fish.
He loves that work and he always made me love that work too when I could come with him.</p>
<p>The open ended and self directed nature of my schooling and my early exposure to the process of doing science helped to cement a strong love of learning at the foundation of my personality.</p>
<h3 id="higher-education">Higher Education<a class="anchor" href="#higher-education">#</a></h3>
<p>I initially went to university to study Physics, one of my favorite subjects from high school.
I finished the requirements of my Physics degree, but along the way I found myself more and more engaged with my Mathematics courses.
During my junior year at University, I decided to change my major to Mathematics, which set me on a path to obtain a Master&rsquo;s and PhD in Mathematics.
All-in-all, I spent most of my twenties studying Mathematics as an academic.</p>
<h4 id="a-little-more-information-for-the-motivated-reader">A Little More Information for the Motivated Reader</h4>
<p>My dissertation was in a subject called Ergodic Theory, which is a subfield of Dynamical Systems.
Yes, dynamical is a real word, I promise.
Very broadly, a dynamical system is a mathematical model that tracks the deterministic evolution of state over time.
Many practitioners would argue that my definition is needlessly restrictive, but this is my website.
Examples of dynamical systems include the motion of planets in our solar system, population models for predators (foxes) and their prey (rabbits), and the motion of a double pendulum.</p>
<p>Many of the interesting problems in Dynamical Systems have to do with systems that display deterministic chaos.
In these systems, governed by completely deterministic rules of evolution, a small change in the initial state of the system results in a large changes in the state of the system after a short period of time.
This property is often called the Butterfly Effect in popular culture.
While the long term behavior of a chaotic dynamical system is technically completely determined by its initial state, it is in many ways effectively random.</p>
<p>Ergodic theory is one of many approaches to studying the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems.
It uses tools from probability theory to explore the similarities between deterministic chaos and randomness.
There are situations when observations of a chaotic dynamical system will exhibit familiar features of random variables.
For example, it is sometimes possible to prove a Central Limit Theorem for observations of a dynamical system.</p>
<p>In my dissertation I used some newer functional analytic methods to prove a generalization of the Central Limit Theorem for a particular class of dynamical systems (Baker&rsquo;s Maps).</p>
<p>Hey, you asked.</p>
<h3 id="teaching">Teaching<a class="anchor" href="#teaching">#</a></h3>
<p>After completing my PhD, I took a job teaching mathematics at the university level.
I had been teaching mathematics as a graduate student for years, but this job brought teaching to the forefront.
I became a Project NExT teaching fellow and spent most of my time and energy teaching mathematics and thinking about math pedagogy.</p>
<h4 id="why-i-left">Why I left</h4>
<p>Over the three years that I spent teaching, I became less and less comfortable with my place in academia.
I had followed my interest in Mathematics through a decade of education because I love learning new things and using what I learn to solve problems.
For me, academia offered a career that was centered around teaching, with some limited support for scholarship.
The world of academic mathematics research is competitive.
I am a competent mathematician, which means that I have an extraordinary grasp of a large body of mathematical knowledge however I am by no means a revolutionary thinker in the field.
Paying me to do academic mathematical research is not going to change the trajectory of ergodic theory.
It took time for me to come to terms with this, but academia had known for a while.</p>
<p>I was a good teacher though.
My students liked me.
I was &lsquo;tough but fair&rsquo;.
My colleagues enjoyed having students who had taken prerequisites with me because they were prepared.
I cared about ensuring that my courses were valuable and high quality products.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t learning new things.
I was polishing my understanding of calculus to a mirror finish, but I wasn&rsquo;t leaning any new Mathematics.
There are plenty of important problems that need to be solved in math education, so I tried learning more about teaching math.
Through Project NExT I was exposed to some of the top thinkers on math pedagogy.
I took away two major learnings from this period.
First, extraordinary things can happen when a small group of highly motivated and engaged students come together with a thoughtful and committed instructor.
Second, the American education system is full of systematic sexism, racism, negative attitudes about students, and financial pressures that work against the interests of students.</p>
<p>From my two learnings, I see essentially two career paths in math education.
First, seek out a position where you will have access to small classes full of well prepared, highly motivated, and engaged students.
Don&rsquo;t be a terrible sexist, racist, negative person.
Do interesting and engaging things.
The thing is, with these students it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what interesting and engaging things you chose.
They will thrive if you can avoid discouraging them and if you can capture their imagination then they will grow even faster.</p>
<p>Second, rise to a position of power and fight to change the systems that make math education such a negative and inaccessible experience for so many students.</p>
<p>I was uncomfortable with the first path because the students that I would be seeking out are extraordinary students who most likely have all of the privilege, self determination, vision, and tenacity to succeed regardless of their instructor. I would be present for their journey, but I would not be learning new things that I could apply to solve important problems.</p>
<p>I have concluded that the second path was not really accessible to me, even if I had the extraordinary will, vision, and determination required to make meaningful change.
My reasoning begins with the following axiom:
Power in academia is intrinsically linked to research output.
I have already conceded that this is not a metric where I am competitive.
Therefore, I cannot gain access to the kind of power required to make meaningful structural changes to math education.</p>
<p>It was time for a course correction.
I needed some time to reevaluate my career choices and approach my professional goals more intentionally.
Honestly, I needed a break.</p>
<h3 id="database-management">Database Management<a class="anchor" href="#database-management">#</a></h3>
<p>Having spent my twenties in school and the last three years teaching, taking a year off to regroup was not a financially viable option.
Lucky for me, my wife was moving on from her position as a database manager to bigger and better things.
She recommended me to her former employer as a replacement.
I didn&rsquo;t know much of anything about managing a database, but I learn fast and my wife writes fantastic documentation.
I was a little nervous about stepping into the role, but it paid a little better than my teaching job, and I needed an escape hatch.</p>
<p>I feel that I have been reasonably successful in my role as database manager.
I have picked up the necessary skills quickly and spearheaded a few interesting projects.
For example, I project managed the design and implementation of a new volunteer management tool that replaced a proprietary tool with an integrated module for our CRM.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed being exposed to the intricacies and challenges of maintaining production IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>I have been working as a database manager for about fifteen months.
The change of pace has done me a world of good and I could not be more grateful for this opportunity that came just in time.</p>
<h3 id="data-science">Data Science<a class="anchor" href="#data-science">#</a></h3>
<p>After some time spent reflecting, I know that I want to build a career that marries my love of mathematics and my new found interests in technology and data.
At the beginning of August I started a boot camp in Data Science as a way to jump start a career in the field.
Over the last nine weeks I have been deeply engaged in learning the tools of Data Science.
I have written more code in the last few weeks than I had in the preceding three decades of my life.</p>
<p>It has been rejuvenating to be so engaged in learning again.
I imagine that my experience is similar to what a distance runner would feel after taking a year off from exercise.
Learning is a necessity for me.
I am not a healthy, happy, functional person when I am not actively learning new things.
Learning the craft of Data Science has given me a powerful sense of purpose and focus.</p>
<p>Pursuing a topic like mathematics to the to the level of academic research warped my perception of learning.
At that level, every step becomes extraordinarily effortful.
It is freeing to realize how much there is to learn that is so much more attainable.</p>
<p>It has also been wonderful to be a student again and remind myself what the experience of education feels like form that perspective.
My cohort is full of interesting and thoughtful people who challenge me and remind me how valuable a supportive and open community is to the learning process.</p>
<p>I am excited to keep expanding my knowledge of Data Science and start applying that knowledge to solve meaningful problems that affect peoples lives directly and immediately.</p>
