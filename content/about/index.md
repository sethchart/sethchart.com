## A Long Story Shortened
![Portrate](PortrateLarge.png)

My name is Seth Chart. I am, in order of decreasing experience, a son, brother, mathematician, teacher, husband, feline personal assistant, database manager, python programmer, web development hobbyist,  data scientist, and blogger.  

## Biography

### The Early Years

I grew up in Utah. My Father is a Fisheries Biologist who has spent his carer working to protect endangered fish species in the western United States. Most of my early memories were formed when we lived in Moab, Utah, where he managed a research field station.

My mother homeschooled me (and my younger brother) through all of elementary and middle school. By the time I reached high school, we had moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. I attended the public high school part time and continued to be homeschooled part time through senior year.

I am grateful for the decades that my mother spent building a bespoke early education for me (and my brother). My education was truly one of a kind, tailored to my interests and idiosyncrasies. The way that I learned during those years was open and free in a way that almost none of my peers have ever had the privilege of experiencing. 

I am grateful for the way that my father has always taught by example. As a young boy, I had the opportunity to ride along with my father on field trips and watch him take joy from the hard work of a field biologist. I got to see that sometimes collecting data means driving for hours on dirt roads into the desert, rowing a raft down a river for days to access habitat, strapping on waders and pulling a seine through chest deep water, then carefully sorting through the contents of the net and collecting and labeling the tiny larval fish. He loves that work and he always made me love that work too when I could come with him. 

The open ended and self directed nature of my schooling and my early exposure to the process of doing science helped to cement a strong love of learning at the foundation of my personality.

### Higher Education

I initially went to university to study Physics, one of my favorite subjects from high school. I finished the requirements of my Physics degree, but along the way I found myself more and more engaged with my Mathematics courses. During my junior year at University, I decided to change my major to Mathematics, which set me on a path to obtain a Masters and PhD in Mathematics. All-in-all, I spent most of my twenties studying Mathematics as an academic. 

#### A Little More Information for the Motivated Reader

My dissertation was in a subject called Ergodic Theory, which is a subfield of Dynamical Systems. No, I didn't misspell Dynamic System. Very broadly, a dynamical system is a mathematical model that tracks the deterministic evolution of state over time. Many practitioners would argue that my definition is needlessly restrictive, but this is my website. Examples of dynamical systems include the motion of planets in our solar system, population models for predators (foxes) and their prey (rabbits), and the motion of a double pendulum.

Many of the interesting problems in Dynamical Systems have to do with systems that display deterministic chaos. In these systems, governed by completely deterministic rules of evolution, a small change in the initial state of the system results in a large changes in the state of the system after a short period of time. This property is often called the Butterfly Effect in popular culture. While the long term behavior of a chaotic dynamical system is technically completely determined by its initial state, it is in many ways effectively random.

Ergodic theory is one of many approaches to studying the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. It uses tools from probability theory to explore the similarities between deterministic chaos and randomness. There are situations when observations of a chaotic dynamical system will exhibit familiar features of random variables. For example, it is sometimes possible to prove a Central Limit Theorem for observations of a dynamical system.

In my dissertation used some newer functional analytic methods to prove a generalization of the Central Limit Theorem for a particular class of dynamical systems (Baker's Maps).

Hey you asked.

### Teaching

After completing my PhD, I took a job teaching mathematics at the university level. I had been teaching mathematics as a graduate student for years, but this job brought teaching to the forefront. I became a Project NExT teaching fellow and spent most of my time and energy teaching mathematics and thinking about math pedagogy.

 Over the three years that I spent teaching, I became less and less comfortable with my place in the academia. I had followed my interest in Mathematics through a decade of education because I love learning new things and using what I learn to solve problems. For me, academia primarily offered a career that was centered around teaching, with some limited support for scholarship. The world of academic mathematics research is competitive. I am a competent mathematician, which means that I have an extraordinary grasp of a large body of mathematical knowledge. However, I am by no means a revolutionary thinker in the field. Paying me to do academic mathematical research is not going to change the trajectory of ergodic theory as a field. It took time for me to come to terms with this, but academia had known for awhile.

I was a good teacher though. My students liked me. I was 'tough but fair'. My colleagues enjoyed having students who had taken prerequisites with me because they were prepared. I cared about ensuring that my courses were valuable and high quality products. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't learning new things. I was polishing my understanding of calculus to a mirror finish, but I wasn't leaning anything new Math. There are plenty of problems with math education, so I tried learning more about math pedagogy. Through Project NExT I was exposed to some of the top thinkers on math pedagogy. I took away two major learnings from this period. First, extraordinary things can happen when a small group of highly motivated and engaged students come together with a thoughtful and committed instructor. Second, the American education system is full of systematic sexism, racism, negative attitudes about students, and financial pressures that work against the interests of students. 

From my two learnings, I see essentially two career paths in math education. First, seek out a position where you will have access to small classes full of well prepared, highly motivated, and engaged students. Don't be a terrible sexist, racist, negative person. Do interesting and engaging things. The thing is, with these students it really doesn't matter what interesting and engaging things you chose. They will thrive if you can avoid discouraging them and if you can capture their imagination then they will grow even faster. Second, rise to a position of power and fight to change the systems that make math education such a negative experience for so many students. 

The first path doesn't appeal to me because it amounts to occupying a teaching position and staying out of the way of extraordinary students who most likely have all of the privilege, self determination, vision, and tenacity to succeed regardless of their instructor. The second path doesn't appeal to me because power in academia is measured in research output and I have already conceded that this is not a metric where I am competitive.

It was time for a course correction. I needed some time to reevaluate my carer choices and approach my professional goals more intentionally. Honestly, I needed a break.

### Database Management

Having spent my twenties in school and the last three years teaching, taking a year off to regroup was not a financially viable option. Lucky for me, my wife was moving on from her position as a database manager to bigger and better things. She recommended me to her former employer as a replacement. I didn't know much of anything about managing a database, but I learn fast and my wife writes fantastic documentation. I was a little nervous about stepping into the role, but it paid a little better than my teaching job, and I needed an escape hatch.

I feel that I have been reasonably successful in my role as database manager. I have picked up the necessary skills quickly and spearheaded a few interesting projects. For example, I project managed the design and implementation of a new volunteer management tool that replaced a proprietary tool with an integrated module for our CRM. 

I have enjoyed being exposed to the intricacies and challenges of maintaining production IT infrastructure. 

I have been working as a database manager for about fifteen months. The change of pace has done me a world of good and I could not be more grateful for the opportunity that came just in time.

### Data Science

After some time spent reflecting, I know that I want to build a carer that marries my love of mathematics and my new found interests in technology and data. At the beginning of August I started a boot camp in Data Science as a way to jump start a carer in the field. So far I am really enjoying how Data Science blends programming, mathematics, statistics, data management, and web technologies to answer interesting questions and help to guide important decisions.
